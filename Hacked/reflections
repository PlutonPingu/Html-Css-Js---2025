So my mission was to create a website with some predetermined things to have in there. 
This is my first class I have ever taken in HTML / CSS / JS. 
If I look at my result now, when I think I'm done, you can tell that I'm not used to this.
      
If I should do this again, I think I would take more help from resources on the internet 
I have been using slides from my teacher, YouTube videos, and some W3Schools.

But I have been sitting here hour after hour just to figure out how to move stuff where I want it to be. 
So it might not be the perfect way done , or I could have done it really fast or better if I had been using some AI to help me or watched more clips. 

I think I got some gray hair after this, and I'm not even that old. 

But in the end , you learn more if you sit down and type it yourself , even if the output may not be the best. 
I think if you get to work with stuff like this on a regular basis, then it would be easier to do. 

So to wrap it up , I'm glad that I have taken this course. I need a lot of practice before I can say that I understand this. 
And even if it was tough to work with, I also had a lot of joy (when it finally worked as I wanted).
