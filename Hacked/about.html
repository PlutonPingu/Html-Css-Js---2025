        This could be a popular game in early 2000.
        </h3>

        <p>
         In the early 2000s we got a lot of games that were made for clicking. <br><br>

         We clicked on stuff like "steal a car". After that, a window with text came up. <br>

         For example, it could be: you managed to steal two cars, and you get 200 xp.
         Or: You tried to steal a car, but the cop was around the corner; you lost 50 health and 100 XP. <br><br>

         The game was like that but with different choices. It could be Steal, Rob, gang wars, and so on. <br><br>

         I have seen some of those games still up and running, but the player count is very low these days. <br><br>

         I don't think I would create one of those games even if i would learn how to do it.
         But for me it's nostalgia, and that's why i did my work like this. <br><br>

         Under here i got a video too one of those games <br>
         The video is 18 years old so its not the best quality, <br>
         but it is the best one i could find out there. <br>
         This game has been down for a while, but is now back up and running. <br><br>
